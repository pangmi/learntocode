1. Basics on Windows file system:
   - [Create folder on C Drive](https://github.com/pangmi/learntocode/blob/main/Lesson02/Files/CreateFolderInCDrive.md)
   - Right click
   - Using right click to do drag and drop
   - Copy  (`Ctrl + C`)
   - Paste (`Ctrl + V`)

2. Download [sample code](https://teachyourkidstocode.com/download/Udemy_code.zip) to the newly created folder in C drive
3. String can be single-quoted or double-quoted
    ```
    str1 = 'Hello'
    str2 = "Hello"
    str3 = "Peter is my sister's dog"

    ```

4. Homework:
    - In our school's cookie sale, Kinston sold 320 cookies, Felix sold 275 and Clara sold 245. Write a program to print out the total number of cookies that they sold, and the average number of cookies that they sold. The expected result should be as below:
      ```
      The total cookies sold: 840
      The average cookies sold: 280
      ```
    
    - Our [Python](https://www.python.org) team has three awesome members: Clara, Felix and Kingston. Write a program to assign each member's name to a variable using single quote or double quote, and print out their names separately and together. The expected result should be as below:
      ```
      We have the following member:
          Clara
          Felix
          Kinston
      
      These are the awesome members in our Python team: [ Clara, Felix, Kingston ]
