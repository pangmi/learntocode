   - `dir`: Displays a list of files and subdirectories in a directory.
   - `cd`: Change directory. `cd \` brings you to the root directory. `cd ..` goes up one level.
   - `md/mkdir`: You can use `md` or `mkdir` to create a new directory. Examples:
      - `md newFolder`: Create a single folder named `newFolder`. 
      - `md folderOne folderTwo folderThree`: Create multiple folders in the current directory 
      - `md \folderOne\folderTwo\folderThree`: Create a new file path that doesnâ€™t currently exist
   - `rd/rmdir`: You can use `rd` or `rmdir` to remove a directory. 
   - `copy`: Copies a specified file to a given location. 
   - `del`: Deletes a file or number of files. Examples:
      - `del someFile.txt`: Delete a specific file named *someFile.txt*
      - `del *.doc`: Delete files with a file type of *doc*. 
      - `del a*` or `del *a.*`: Delete files with names beginning with or ending with a specific letter
   - `move`: Rename a file, or move a file from one location to another. 
   - `cls`: Clears the screen.
   - **Change the Drive**:  type the drive's letter, followed by ":". For instance, if you wanted to change the drive to "D:", you can type `d:` and then press Enter on your keyboard.
   - You can always get help on the command with `/?`. For example: `copy /?`

#### 2. Be aware of infinite loop:

   ``` Python
   x = 1
   while x <= 20:
       square = x ** 2
       print(x, '->', square)
   ```
