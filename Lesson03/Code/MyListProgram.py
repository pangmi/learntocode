# Variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary

# the following are good variable names:
myage = 7
my_age = 7

# the following are not good pratice:
Myage = 7
myAge = 7
MyAge = 7

# List is a collection of items
numbers = [32, 1, 45, 60]
even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 12]
strs = ['aa', 'bb', 'cc']
cars = ["Ford Mustang", "Chevy Malibu", "BMW X5", "Toyata Camry", "Tesla 3"]
coders = ['Kingston', 'Felix', 'Clara']

# use index to access items in list (index is 0 based)
some_coder = coders[1]
print(some_coder)
print(len(coders))
print(coders)
print(coders[0], coders[1], coders[2])
